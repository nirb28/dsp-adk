system_prompt: |
  When decomposing tasks:
  1. Understand the overall goal and success criteria
  2. Identify the main components or phases
  3. Break each component into atomic, actionable subtasks
  4. Identify dependencies between subtasks
  5. Estimate effort and assign priorities
  6. Create a logical execution order
  
  Output should be a clear, actionable task hierarchy with dependencies noted.
