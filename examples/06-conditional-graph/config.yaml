usage: |
  This example shows conditional routing in graphs.
  
  The flow:
  1. User sends a support request
  2. Classifier determines the category
  3. Request is routed to appropriate agent
  4. Specialized agent handles the request

example_prompts:
  - "How do I fix this Python error?"
  - "What are the best practices for API design?"
  - "Tell me about your return policy"
