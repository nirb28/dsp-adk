usage: |
  This example shows the orchestrator pattern for complex tasks.
  
  The orchestrator:
  1. Receives a complex task
  2. Decomposes it into subtasks (task-decomposition skill)
  3. Delegates subtasks to specialized agents
  4. Coordinates parallel execution where possible
  5. Handles errors and retries
  6. Aggregates results into final output

example_prompts:
  - "Research AI trends, analyze market data, and create an investment report"
  - "Investigate the bug, fix it, test, and document the changes"
  - "Analyze customer feedback, identify patterns, and suggest improvements"
