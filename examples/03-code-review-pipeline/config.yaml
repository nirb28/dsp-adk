usage: |
  This example shows how to build a code review pipeline.
  
  The workflow:
  1. User provides file path or code snippet
  2. Agent uses file-operations to read the code
  3. Agent analyzes for bugs, security issues, style
  4. Agent suggests improvements with examples
  5. Optionally generates tests for the code

example_prompts:
  - "Review the code in src/main.py"
  - "Check this function for security issues"
  - "Suggest improvements for better performance"
