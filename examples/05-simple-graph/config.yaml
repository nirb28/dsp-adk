usage: |
  This example shows a simple sequential graph.
  
  The flow:
  START → research → summarize → END
  
  1. User provides a topic
  2. Research agent gathers information
  3. Conversational agent summarizes findings
  4. User receives concise summary

example_prompts:
  - "Research and summarize the history of the internet"
  - "Find information about climate change and summarize key points"
